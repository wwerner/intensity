# intensity

Intensity is a small tool used in psychotherapy sessions by the patient to record and review 
the subjective intensity of feelings.

It is based on the [SUD scale (subjective units of distress)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_units_of_distress_scale).

It is used in [EMDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing), [brainspotting](https://brainspotting.com/), [Traumafokus](https://www.traumafokus.com/) and anxiety expositions.
